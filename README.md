### SPA Website (unfinished project)
The goal of this project was to recreate a single-page spa website, which I originally built using WordPress, from scratch using only HTML and CSS, with some dynamic features powered by JavaScript.

The website includes basic interactive elements such as redirection to Booksy, a map, a pricing list, and panels showcasing different massage services, though visual improvements were not fully completed.

Below are example screenshots from the beginning of the page:
